I am really interested in working on a browser extension that filters out "spoiler" results when searching about shows or movies (ex: John Smith death). 

I think a blessed repository is the best way to go. That way, there is always one master repository and if we want to make changes, we can make branches and make sure they are approved before merging. 

I think branching is a good way to organize repositories because it allows people to work on parts of the code without interfering with the "stable" or current version.
